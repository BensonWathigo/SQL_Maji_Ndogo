We can also see that there are no differences between they types of water sources from the auditor report and the surveyors records being compared, so we are safe to proceed with our investigation on that account. Moving forward, the SQL query we created will definitely get more complex so let's see how we can make our lives easier by using **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**. To do this, we wrap the query we have in a **CTE** and name the expression as `Incorrect_records`. This allows us to break our query down into simpler & more digestable steps. It also enables us to use the referenced query as if it was a table.\r\n",
